# FunctionalCARA

## R documents introduction

R file ufun: functions used in the simulations.

Please run FunctionalCARA first to check your packages and load the following data:

Tr.est: Coordinates of triangles used to set up the simulation study.

V.est: Vertices of the triangles.

Z: expanded grid for the rectangular box containing the object with an irregular boundary.

R file FunctionalCARA is responding to the first simulation in the Chapter 3. It compares the performance between equal allocation with three CARA designs.

R file sFPCA_FPCA is the second simulation in the Chapter 3. It compares different value of hyperparameter theta in the sFPCA.

R file Real Case Study is the simulation in the chapter 4.
